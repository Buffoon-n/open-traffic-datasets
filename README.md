open traffic datasets

1. [Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/)  
   Caltrans PeMS is a software tool designed specifically for Caltrans. It is the centralized repository for all of Caltrans’ real-time traffic data, enabling easy access to these data that might otherwise be dispersed across multiple districts and more difficult to obtain.
2. [Seattle Inductive Loop Detector Dataset V.1 (2015)](https://github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data)  
   The data is collected by the inductive loop detectors deployed on freeways in Seattle area. The freeways contains I-5, I-405, I-90, and SR-520, shown in the above picture. This dataset contains spatio-temporal speed information of the freeway system. In the picture, each blue icon demonstrates loop detectors at a milepost. The speed information at a milepost is averaged from multiple loop detectors on the mainlanes in a same direction at the specific milepost. The time interal of the dataset is 5-minute.
3. [OpenITS: OpenData](http://www.openits.cn/openData/index.jhtml)  
   OpenData模块的主要目标是建立多源异构交通大数据的数据资源描述、共享与应用规范与标准体系，并实现面向互联网的、开放的数据共享服务，为交通科学研究提供强大的数据支持和基础。 
4. [FHWA](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/)  
   State highway agencies collect traffic volume data through both temporary traffic counting and continuous traffic counting programs and report their continuous counting data to FHWA on a monthly basis. Data listed here are reported by states following data format prescribed in FHWA's 2001 Traffic Monitoring Guide located at [this page](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/)
5. [MnDOT traffic data](http://www.d.umn.edu/~tkwon/TMCdata/TMCarchive.html)  
   RTMC *.traffic Data (Archived Loop Data) Downloads Provided by Dr. Taek M. Kwon. The data in this archive are continuously collected by the Regional Trasportation Management Center (RTMC), a division of MnDOT, at a 30-second interval from over 4,500 loop detectors located around the Twin Cities Metro freeways, seven days a week and all year round.
